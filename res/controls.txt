To move this machine,
press the W, A, S, or D keys.
The arrow keys will work
just fine too. The movment
works like driving. You
have to turn before going
in the direction you want.

To fire the anti-wasp
weapons, hold the left
mouse or the right one.
These instructions say,
"Remember, the turret
takes a while to turn to the
yonder mouse place, so
fire only when ready."
