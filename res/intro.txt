 THE MAIZE RUNNER

 by Terrell Ford



It's Saturday in the Great


State of Texas and wasps


are flying around as usual.


The only problem is that


there are too many wasps


around to get any work


done, and it seems like


every time I turn around, a


new wasp appears.




  "There. All done."


I've just finished what I


think can be a Trump card


against all the annoying


wasps. It's a robot. 


I can't wait to let it


start running so I can


stop thinking about how to


wall out the wasps and


focus more on the upcoming


harvest. Let's get to work.




One more thing... all these


new-fangled robots seem to


have a very small battery


life. As such, the robot


will only run for 3:00.
