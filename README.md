I've been very involved in a robotics team outside of my normal work for the last
6 weeks. I was asked by members of that team to create a game to present at an
area-wide competition between robotics teams.

I coded this game over a two-week period but I also reused old generic code from
previous programs I've built. As with my previous submissions, I'll say that I 
hope you have fun trying out this program. I'd also appreciate any comments or
suggestions on improving the game, even just to know someone actually played this.
